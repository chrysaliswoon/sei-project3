# 💰 Personal Financial Tracker

## 💻 Project Brief
### Technical Requirements

- Use MongoDB, Express, React and Node
- Have at least 2 related models (with references) and an additional user model with authentication. There should be at least 2 types of users.
- Include all major CRUD functions for at least one of the models
- Manage team contributions and collaboration by using standard Git flow on Github.
- Nicely styled front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS, with or without a framework.
- Deploy your application online, so that it is publically accessible
- User stories that apply to the functionality of your app, crafted as a team.
- Wireframes for the views you planned to create

### Final Deliverables

- A **working app, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project.
- **A `readme.md` file** with:
  - Explanations of the **technologies** used
  - A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
  - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
  - Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
  - Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
  - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome
- A `presentation.md` of "slides" that walk through a demo of your app.

## 📜 Description

A personal financial tracker to track how much you spend and earn and take charge of your finances. Users are able to track their assets and expenditures which will visually convert the data into daigrams and charts. 

### ⚙️ Technical Used
For this project, we used the following technologies:

```
- React: CRA
- Bootstrap with React
- MongoDB
- Express
- Postman
- Storybook
- Jest
- Figma
- Github Desktop
```

### 🚀 Get Started
- Clone or download the repo
- `npm install`

### 📝 Wireframes

For our wireframe, we used Figma to create an initial skeleton of what the project will look like, and identify the necessary component and files. You can view the wireframe [here](https://www.figma.com/file/T4dnXmXGpywDvNKPRQh0ss/Project-3?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=4ib42sNRdyzkJm20-1)

###  User Stories

## 💡 Planning and Development Process

We had approximately 3 weeks from ideation to creation to develop a fullstack application. Below is a rough estimation of how we had broken down our task lists:

1. Set up the Github Repository using the template given in the project page

2. Brainstorm for ideas (FigJam) and identified which project to do based on an overall score. 
   - Each one of us could put a score between 1 - 10 (1: Not very keen; 10: Really keen on doing)
   - After the scoring was indicated, we added the scores and took the highest scoring project

3. Set up the project files and installed the necessary dependencies
   Front-end:
   - CRA: npx create-react-app
   - Storybook: npx sb init
   - Jest: npm i --save-dev jest

4. Created a user persona (FigJam) to identify features of the financial tracker and userflow.

5. Created a UML diagram (FigJam) to visually represent the architecture, design, and implementation of our financial tracker.

6. Created sample data for project -> Help to establish models

7. Deployed the React app on Vercel successfully 

8. Set up component files and pages based on wireframe

### Problem-Solving Strategy

In order to have clarity on what was required to create the project, our first priority was creating a wireframe and a working prototype to have a visual of how everything would flow. By creating a wireframe, it also allowed us to see what components and pages we would need to create our project, and delegate the tasks. 

We spent quite a bit of time brainstorming and figuring out what components and data we needed to create and collect before starting the actual coding.
